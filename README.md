# jose - Javascript Object Signing and Encryption & JWT (JSON Web Token)

*jose* is a Haskell implementation of [Javascript Object Signing and
Encryption](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/) and [JSON Web
Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).

The JSON Web Signature (JWS; RFC 7515) implementation is complete.
JSON Web Encryption (JWE; RFC 7516) is not yet implemented.

**EdDSA** signatures (RFC 8037) are supported (Ed25519 only).

JWK Thumbprint (RFC 7638) is supported (requires *aeson* >= 0.10).

[Contributions](#contributing) are welcome.

## Security

If you discover a security issue in this library, please email me
the details, ideally with a proof of concept (`frase @ frase.id.au`
; [PGP key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x4B5390524111E1E2)).

Before reporting an issue, please note the following known
vulnerabilities:

- The **ECDSA** implementation is vulnerable to **timing attacks** and
  should therefore only be used for verification.

and the following known **not-vulnerabilities**:

- The library is not vulnerable to [JWS **algorithm substitution
  attacks**](
  https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/).
  Haskell's type system excludes this attack.

- The default JWS validation settings reject the **`"none"`
  algorithm**, as [required by RFC 7518](
  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.6).

- The library is not vulnerable to ECDH [**invalid curve attacks**](
  https://blogs.adobe.com/security/2017/03/critical-vulnerability-uncovered-in-json-encryption.html)
  because JWE is not implemented.


## Interoperability issues

The following known interoperability issues will not be addressed,
so please do not open issues:

- Some JOSE tools and libraries permit the use of **short keys**, in
  violation of the RFCs.  This implementation rejects JWS or JWT
  objects minted with short keys, as required by the RFCs.

- The *Auth0* software produces objects with an [invalid `"x5t"`
  parameter](
  https://community.auth0.com/questions/7227/certificate-thumbprint-is-longer-than-20-bytes).
  The datum [should be a base64url-encoded SHA-1 digest](
  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.7), but *Auth0*
  produces a base64url-encoded hex-encoded SHA-1 digest.  The object
  can be repaired
  ([example](https://github.com/frasertweedale/hs-jose/issues/54#issuecomment-356460452))
  so that this library will admit it, unless the offending parameter
  is part of the *JWS Protected Header* in which case you are out of
  luck (until *Auth0* bring their implementation into compliance).

- JWKs with leading null bytes in the RSA `"n"` parameter (a
  [violation of RFC
  7518](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-2)) have been
  [seen in the
  wild](https://github.com/frasertweedale/hs-jose/issues/68).  This
  library rejects nonconformant JWKs.  If you know which
  programs/libraries produce such objects, please file bugs against
  them.  It is straightforward to repair these keys:
  base64url-decode the offending parameter, drop the leading null
  byte, base64url-encode again then update the JSON object.
