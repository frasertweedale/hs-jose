Key stores.  Instances are provided for 'JWK' and 'JWKSet'.  These
instances ignore the header and payload and just return the JWK/s
they contain.  More complex scenarios, such as efficient key lookup
by @"kid"@ or searching a database, can be implemented by writing a
new instance.

For example, the following instance looks in a filesystem directory
for keys based on either the JWS Header's @"kid"@ parameter, or the
  @"iss"@ claim in a JWT Claims Set:

@
-- | A KeyDB is just a filesystem directory
newtype KeyDB = KeyDB FilePath

instance (MonadIO m, HasKid h)
    => VerificationKeyStore m (h p) ClaimsSet KeyDB where
  getVerificationKeys h claims (KeyDB dir) = liftIO $
    fmap catMaybes . traverse findKey $ catMaybes
      [ preview (kid . _Just . param) h
      , preview (claimIss . _Just . string) claims]
    where
    findKey :: T.Text -> IO (Maybe JWK)
    findKey s =
      let path = dir <> "/" <> T.unpack s <> ".jwk"
      in handle
        (\(_ :: IOException) -> pure Nothing)
        (decode <$> L.readFile path)

    => VerificationKeyStore m (h p) ClaimsSet JWKsURI where
  getVerificationKeys h claims (JWKsURI url) = liftIO $
    traverse findKey (preview (kid . _Just . param) h) >>=
      (return . maybe [] pure) . join
    where
    findKey :: T.Text -> IO (Maybe JWK)
    findKey kid' = handle
        (\(_ :: SomeException) -> pure Nothing)
        $ do
            response <- getKeys url
            keys <- getVerificationKeys h claims response

            return $ find (\j -> j ^. jwkKid == Just kid') keys

getKeys :: String -> IO JWKSet
getKeys url = do
    r <- parseRequest url

    let request = setRequestCheckStatus r

    eresponse <- httpJSON request
